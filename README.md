## Fortis
This repository contains a light-weight implementation of a transformer
neural network using dynamic computation graphs. Almost no feature has 
been implemented at the moment, but features will be added progressively. 

Note: This repository is meant for educational purposes. 


### Tasks to Consider
    - Named Entity Recognition
    - Question Answering
    - Text Classification 

### Features
    - Support for data-parallel training 
    - SGD and Adam 

### Metrics to Implement 
    - F1 score
    - Precision 
    - Recall 
    - F-measure 

### Benchmarks
    - GLUE benchmarks
