## Fortis
This repository contains a light-weight deep learning library that uses
dynamic computation graphs. Almost no feature has been implemented at the
moment, but features will be added progressively. The goal is to have a 
well-maintained C++ library with wrappers for Rust (and potentially Python
if need be).

Note: This repository is meant for educational purposes.
